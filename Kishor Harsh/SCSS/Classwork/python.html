    <h1>Python Info</h1>
    <div id="div0">Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules,
         exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple 
         programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming.
          Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, 
          as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension 
          language for applications that need a programmable interface. 
        Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.

    <h1>Python Founder</h1>
    <div id="div1">
        Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) 
        in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, 
        capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. 
        Its implementation began in December 1989.
