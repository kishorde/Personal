        Sass (which stands for 'Syntactically awesome style sheets) is an extension of 
        CSS that enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more. 
        It also helps to keep things organised and allows you to create style sheets faster.
        Sass is compatible with all versions of CSS.
